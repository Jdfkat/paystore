1. Created form with basic fields to post to paypal [no return, notify_url, cancel set]
2. Form being posted to paypal
3. Paypal sends back response which are captured as a request in a controller and 
   saved to a file [NOPE]
   Solution: configure sandbox properly or use a live paypal for it
   IPN simulator
   return and notify [same routes?] to check
   * Make sure that form is contructed properly [cmd values etc.]
   * Make sure that route where ipn is posting back is working and is of type post
   * Try to catch values posted back by IPN = check ipn history for this.

how it was solved:

1. make sure that form has the correct values
2. make sure that ipn is on and the correct listener is set
   for local test ipn you can use a tool to simula you hv a real server [e.g. ngrok]
3. make sure that your curl config is okay and you validate your request, timeout check etc.
4. if you are developing locally, make sure you have your cert installed on local development
5. Make sure that the email for sanbox used [in the business field] is the email you get you get automatically for your sandbox

  add the emails etc. in a config files so that they can be used properly
  environment variables, then config variable

  To do [the above]
  

- IPN History doesn't display today's [09/09] data => make sure that your account is a business one [YES, account is business]

- https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/ipn/ht-ipn/
  update migrations for payment logs to include additional information such as txn_id etc.
  see link above

https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/Sandbox-Environment/Sandbox-Payment-Status-always-pending-why/td-p/1417716
status still pending supposedly because email is not verified
Status still pending supposedly because payer and buyer currency are different.
Was supposed to use sandbox email rather than the payment eail.

IPN Simulator to see what's happening

1. Post to notify url work [e.g. when posting a form, data is received]
2. SSL to be installed on the local or server
3. CURL time out [savoir comment faire du curl a partir de Lara]
   curl increased time out to 500 seconds didnt help. no error logged to error file
   Troubleshoot why no post was received.
